# EHM-428 Introduction to Machine Vision and Pattern Recognition
## Brain Tumor Detection from MR Image In MATLAB
### 1.1. The subject of the project
Brain tumors grow in the skull by their pressure on the brain.
It can be life threatening in the advanced stages. Malignant brain tumors in recent years
It has become one of the important causes of deaths. If the tumor is at an early stage
If it can be identified and classified correctly, patients' chances of survival can be increased.
The most appropriate treatment to choose for brain cancer, the doctor will tell you about the type and location of the tumor.
It depends on the precise determination of its size and boundaries. Therefore, the radiologist and
to help doctors detect brain tumors with high success.
It is extremely important to use a computer-aided diagnosis / detection system. In this study, MR
Performing brain tumor analysis using MATLAB on images
is targeted. For this purpose, an application software with a user interface has been designed.
Thus, the possible decision-making stages of the physicians can be
preventing mistakes and using the designed application as a secondary tool
is targeted. Successful detection of brain tumors with the help of the designed application
It has been seen that.
### 1.2.What Are Project Targets?
Developing an application with a visual user interface using MATLAB.
1. Developing an application with a visual user interface
2. Detecting brain tumor using MR Images
3. To MR Images implementation of Median Filter, Edge Detection, Segmentation algorithms
4. Draw the histogram of the sample picture.
5. Designing an application that can open all image formats
Brain Tumor Detection program from the user-interface MR Images
aims to achieve the above goals.
### 1.3. What Are Technologies Used In The Project?
To MR Images Programming language used in Artificial Intelligence, Signal Processing and Image Processing project
It is the MATLAB programming language that is frequently preferred in its field.
## How Do I Execute The Program?
* After the Matlab program is opened, the program is started by selecting the mainmenu.fig file.
- Note You need to change the Cover Image path in the mainmenu.m file to the location of the face.png image on your computer.## Screenshot 
### Mainmenu 
In the main menu, a menu with a visual user interface is designed in Matlab. Brain tumor detection can be done in two ways. First of them in [Quick Detection of Brain Tumors ](https://github.com/ugurilgin/Brain-Tumor-Detection-in-Matlab/blob/main/Matlab%20Beyin%20Tümörü%20Tespiti/hizlitumor.m) 
less detailed brain tumor detection can be performed. Second of them in
[Detection of Brain Tumors with Details ](https://github.com/ugurilgin/Brain-Tumor-Detection-in-Matlab/blob/main/Matlab%20Beyin%20Tümörü%20Tespiti/detaylitumor.m)  
Detailed brain tumor detection results can be accessed..
